## Safety and Quality Considerations

```mermaid
mindmap
  root((Ice Resurfacing<br/>Safety & Quality))
    Safety Considerations
      Blade Depth Limits
        Never exceed machine max
        Progressive adjustment
      Speed Control
        Slower for aggressive cuts
        Maintain control
      Ice Temperature
        Ideal: 22-26¬∞F
        Optimal cutting conditions
    Quality Factors
      Overlap Patterns
        50% overlap between passes
        Avoid ridges
      Blade Condition
        Sharp blades essential
        Prevent ice tearing
      Surface Finish
        Professional skating quality
        Ready for normal maintenance
    Expected Results
      Ice Removal
        1.5-2 inches reduction
        Crown to level surface
      Equipment Efficiency
        Uses existing resurfacer
        No special tools needed
      Predictable Outcome
        Each pass has purpose
        Reduced over-cutting risk
